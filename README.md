### Blender3d_cuby_wallpaper
Phone wallpaper made with [Blender3D](https://github.com/blender/blender) using the bpy library under the scripting section. Initially based on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8hqLh_HE08">David Mignot Youtube Tutorial</a>.
Cameras, lights and minor adjustments done by hand (yet). Feel free to download and use them on your phone!

#### Using this script:
To be able to use this script inside Blender, you need first to download Blender Software at it's [Official Website Download Page](https://www.blender.org/download/). You can also download at the [Windows App Store](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/blender/9PP3C07GTVRH) if you're using Windows 10/11.

1. Under Blender's Scripting tab, simply load the script by opening the file "Cuby.py" inside the Text Editor View (Shortcut: Alt + O). 
2. To generate the geometry, simply hit the Play button above the Text Editor View. This may take a while to completely run the script.
3. And there you go!

In this scene, some minor changes were done by hand i.e. adjusting lights, textures, compositing, object rotation, adding cameras and rendering.
It's possible to explore a lot more in Blender to actually do all of this automatically using Python. You can also experiment rendering multiple scenes at once only using code. Feel free to fork this project if you want to discover more on your own!
